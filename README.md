This GitHub repository contains a project focused on stock market prediction using machine learning techniques. The project includes several Jupyter Notebook files that explore the prediction of stock prices for various companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), AstraZeneca (AZN), Reliance Industries (RELIANCE), State Bank of India (SBIN), Tata Motors (TATAMOTORS), Tesla (TSLA), and Unilever (ULVR).

Main Function Points
Stock data preprocessing and feature engineering
Development of machine learning models for stock price prediction
Evaluation and comparison of different prediction models
Deployment of the prediction models using a Flask web application
Technology Stack
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
Flask (for web application deployment)
